              Hello everyone!!</br></br></br> No matter whether your goal is weight loss or</br> just for a healthy lifestyle and general well-being, </br></br>I will emphasize on the importance of eating clean, home-cooked, with least possible processing, lots of fruits and veggies.
            </br></br> Do you know, that weight loss is 80% diet and just 20% workout.</br></br>
          </br><div class="lead"style="background-color:lightgoldenrodyellow"> Even if you aren't aiming for weight loss, healthy eating is crucial coz:-</br>
             1) Proper nutrients are a must for young and growing children.</br>
            </br> 2) For adults, it maintains their health, giving them enough energy</br> to be able to work hard and smart, it also prevents onset of diseases in later stages of life.</br>
          </br> 3) For those in their midlife, it allows them to have good, energy, health and prevents chronic diseses.

      <ul type="none" style="font-weight:bold ;">
        <li>1)Always remember to warm-up and cool-down before and after workout.</li>
        <li>2)I would recommend you to start with guided video workouts, if you are a newbie.</li>
        <li>3)Always remember, the quality of your workouts is much more important than the time spent/no of reps.</li>
        <li>4)Learn and workout only in proper posture for maximum benefits and to prevent injury.</li>
        <li>5)Incorporate a variety of workouts in your routine.</li>
        <li>6)Do remember to have an active rest day atleast twice a week.</li>
        <li>7)If you are alone, and in need of a workout buddy, just workout along with the video workouts.</li>
        <li>8)Try to add challenges, variety and increase your workout levels.</li>
        <li>9)If you are just in it for the general health and fitness ,</br> workout for about 150 mins per week at a moderate intensity. </li>
        <li>10)If you are aiming for weight loss, workout for about 300 mins per week at a moderate-high intensity level.</li>
        <li>11)If you are a newbie, remember to start it small and slow, but be consistent.</li>
        <li>12)Eat healthy for maximum results and just good overall health.</li>
